  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">How the Web Works</h2>
    <p class="info">
      The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. A person types in a domain name to access a web page using a computer browser such as Chrome, Opera, Safari, or, when desperate, Internet Explorer. When the person goes to the web page,
      the computer sends an <b>HTTP Request</b> to a <b>Server</b>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where said web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
      <br>
      <br> This <b><a href="http://tinyurl.com/kyvy45g">Components of the Web Video</a></b> does a good job of explaining the concept.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">HTML</h2>
    <p class="info">
      <b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <b>text content</b> which describes "what you see" and <b>markup</b>      which describes "how it looks".
      <br>
      <br> This <b><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ml235wp">
          Intro to HTML Video</a></b> gives a good overview.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Tags and Elements</h2>
    <p class="info">
      HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. An element begins with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
      <br>
      <br> This <b><a href="http://tinyurl.com/l5ozwqg">Into to HTML Tags Video</a></b> explains the distinction well.

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Why Computers are Stupid</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Programmers Don't Have to Know Everything</h2>
    <p class="info">
      There are so many details involved with coding. A rookie mistake is to try to memorize everything. It is more common to copy and paste bits of code, and Google will become your best friend.
      <br>
      <br>That is why I actually used Andy's Notes as the foundation of the assignment and tweaked it for my purposes. (I hope that this is allowed!) :-)
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
    <p class="info">
      HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them while inline elements appear, well, inline. Go figure. For future reference, span is inline, and div is block.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">CSS</h2>
    <p class="info">
      <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document within the markup language. CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. For more detailed information about
      CSS, see <a href="  http://www.w3.org/wiki/Inheritance_and_cascade">this explanation.</a>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">DOM</h2>
    <p class="info">
      <b>DOM (Document Object Model)</b> is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure called the
      DOM Tree.
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">More about the Tree-Like Structure</h2>
    <p class="info">
      When using the Google Chrome Developer Tools, you can see how the structure is organized by clikcing on the sideways triangles. Each triangle covers the information from opening tag to closing tag.

  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">The Relationship of CSS to the Web Page</h2>
    <p class="info">There are different ways to include CSS styling in a web page. These include:
      <br>
      <p class="list">(1) In short projects like those that you write in scratchpad.io, you can write the CSS code directly in the header element.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="list">(2) You can link the HTML to a separate CSS file. THe HTML and CSS would be written in two distinct documents. You would link them by adding a <em>header</em> element to the top of the HTML files and adding a <em>link</em> element inside of the
          <em>header</em> element. More details can be found in the Udacity course, but you basically add the CSS file name to the <em>link</em> element that automatically populates when you type "link" in Sublime.
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="list">(3) You can code the style inline with HTML code, but this is a bad idea as it requires a TON of repetition!
            <br>

    <p class="imgbox"><img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="http://yvonneenglish.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Box-Model.png" alt="An illustration of the box model"></p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">The Relationship Between Indented HTML and Boxes</h2>
    <p class="info">
      When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box"" is.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Tips: Box Sizing and Equally Fun Four-Sided Stuff</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>You can set the size of a box in px or %. If you used pixels, it is static, so it is not responsive. This can result in a bad user experience.</li>
      <li>Using flexbox (flexible box) is an efficient way to layout space in a container. It gives you a way to have your HTML elements easily adjust their size based on the size of the page. A <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">complete guide</a>        to flexbox can be found here.</li>
      <li>Divs are block elements as opposed to inline elements, so, by default, they take up the entire width of their parent element. Adding the rule <em>"display: flex;"</em> to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to
        each other.
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Code, Test, Refine, Baby!</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Look for natural boxes.</li>
      <li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.</li>
      <li>Write your HTML.</li>
      <li>Apply styles (from BIGGEST to smallest).</li>
      <li>Fix things.</li>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Warning: Common HTML and CSS Errors</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li><b>Syntax Errors:</b> Everything must be exact. That means remembering to close elements and the like!</li>

      <li><b>Avoid Repetition:</b> If you give the same style to similar elements, you can change all of them at once just by changing a single line of CSS. This also limits the potential for errors. The final benefit is that it saves a TON of time.</li>

      <li><b>Validation:</b> Make sure to validate your code (see next section for links).</li>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Important Definitions</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li><u>Computer</u>: A computer is a machine that can carry out instructions given to it by a programmer.</li>
      <li><u>Programming</u>: Tells the computer what to do through the use of a precise sequence of steps.</li>
      <li><u>Computer Programming Language</u>: A programming language is what programmers use to tell a computer what to do. Python is one example of a programming language.</li>
      <li><u>Python</u>: Python is a programming language. When you write Python code and press "Run", a Python Interpreter converts the code you wrote as a set of instructions that the computer itself can understand and execute.</li>
      <li><u>Grammar</u>: Grammar refers to the rules that govern what statements are 'legal' in a language. Python has its own grammar.</li>
      <li><u>Python Expressions</u>: A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. For example: <em>print 1 + 1</em> is a valid expression, but <em>print 1 +</em> (without a number at the end) is not.</li>
    </ul>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Why invent new languages?</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Why do we need to invent new languages like Python rather than using natural languages like English or Mandarin?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ambiguity - We often have different meanings for the same word, and the computer needs specificity.</li>
      <li>Verbosity - Computers need a more efficient language.</li>
